## Deployment

[Sass Project!](https://sanjula8.github.io/SASS-Project/)

Just a little project I did using SCSS and custom grid after following Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and SASS course.

### Future Edits

-   Maybe add up-to-date responsiveness.
-   Fix popup on smaller screens.
-   Use different themes/colors.
-   Fix navigation panel to include hamburger menu.
